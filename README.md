This is a tool to search companies websites for open roles. Currently works for Google and Adobe (Workday based).


1. Searches for particular openings (by default software tester,software developer and QA, but it's possible to input different role)
2. Checks for already closed roles
3. Saves result to file for future reference


Above search results were created using codes privided in ![search_for_jobs.py](search_for_jobs.py?raw=true) file.
